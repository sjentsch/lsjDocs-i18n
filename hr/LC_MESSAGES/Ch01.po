"In fact, come to think of it, this sounds a lot like a psychological "
"question to me, and since I do work in a psychology department, it seems "
"like a good idea to dig a little deeper here. Is it really plausible to "
"think that this “common sense” approach is very trustworthy? Verbal "
"arguments have to be constructed in language, and all languages have biases "
"– some things are harder to say than others, and not necessarily because "
"they’re false (e.g., quantum electrodynamics is a good theory, but hard to "

"That was the basis for my somewhat glib remarks earlier, but that’s not "
"exactly the whole story, is it? After all, if we’re interested in this from "
"a more sociological and psychological perspective, we might want to ask "
"*why* there are such strong gender differences in applications. Why do males "
"tend to apply to engineering more often than females, and why is this "
"reversed for the English department? And why is it the case that the "
"departments that tend to have a female-application bias tend to have lower "
"overall admission rates than those departments that have a male-application "
"bias? Might this not still reflect a gender bias, even though every single "
"department is itself unbiased? It might. Suppose, hypothetically, that males "
"preferred to apply to “hard sciences” and females prefer “humanities”. And "
"suppose further that the reason for why the humanities departments have low "
"admission rates is because the government doesn’t want to fund the "
"humanities (Ph.D. places, for instance, are often tied to government funded "
"research projects). Does that constitute a gender bias? Or just an "
"unenlightened view of the value of the humanities? What if someone at a high "
"level in the government cut the humanities funds because they felt that the "
"humanities are “useless chick stuff”. That seems pretty *blatantly* gender "
"biased. None of this falls within the purview of statistics, but it matters "
"to the research project. If you’re interested in the overall structural "
"effects of subtle gender biases, then you probably want to look at *both* "
"the aggregated and disaggregated data. If you’re interested in the decision "
"making process at Berkeley itself then you’re probably only interested in "
"the disaggregated data."

"To be perfectly honest, there’s a few different reasons, some of which are "

"statistical science. What I mean by that is that the “things” that we study "

"Thirdly, there’s a big practical problem with being dependent on other "

"charges for university fees, you’ll notice something interesting: statistics "

"So far, most of what I’ve talked about is statistics, and so you’d be "
"forgiven for thinking that statistics is all I care about in life. To be "
"fair, you wouldn’t be far wrong, but research methodology is a broader "
"concept than statistics. So most research methods courses will cover a lot "

"particular the issues that you encounter when trying to do research with "
"humans. However, about 99% of student *fears* relate to the statistics part "
"of the course, so I’ve focused on the stats in this discussion, and "
"hopefully I’ve convinced you that statistics matters, and more importantly, "
"that it’s not to be feared. That being said, it’s pretty typical for "
"introductory research methods classes to be very stats-heavy. This is not "
"(usually) because the lecturers are evil people. Quite the contrary, in "
"fact. Introductory classes focus a lot on the statistics because you almost "
"always find yourself needing statistics before you need the other research "
"methods training. Why? Because almost all of your assignments in other "
"classes will rely on statistical training, to a much greater extent than "
"they rely on other methodological tools. It’s not common for undergraduate "
"assignments to require you to design your own study from the ground up (in "
"which case you would need to know a lot about research design), but it *is* "
"common for assignments to ask you to analyse and interpret data that were "
"collected in a study that someone else designed (in which case you need "
"statistics). In that sense, from the perspective of allowing you to do well "
