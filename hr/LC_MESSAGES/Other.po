"*learning statistics with jamovi* covers the contents of an introductory "
"statistics class, as typically taught to undergraduate psychology students. "
"It is also available `as a textbook <https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/"
">`__. It discusses how to get started in jamovi as well as giving an "
"introduction to data manipulation. From a statistical perspective, the book "
"discusses descriptive statistics and graphing first, followed by chapters on "
"probability theory, sampling and estimation, and null hypothesis testing. "
"After introducing the theory, the book covers the analysis of contingency "
"tables, correlation, *t*-tests, regression, ANOVA and factor analysis. "
"Bayesian statistics are covered at the end of the book."

"This update from version 0.65 introduces some new analyses. In the ANOVA "
"chapters we have added sections on repeated measures ANOVA and analysis of "
"covariance (ANCOVA). In a new chapter, we have introduced Factor analysis "
"and related techniques. Hopefully the style of this new material is "
"consistent with the rest of the book, though eagle-eyed readers might spot a "
"bit more of an emphasis on conceptual and practical explanations, and a bit "
"less algebra. I’m not sure this is a good thing, and might add the algebra "
"in a bit later. But it reflects both my approach to understanding and "
"teaching statistics, and also some feedback I have received from students on "
"a course I teach. In line with this, I have also been through the rest of "
"the book and tried to separate out some of the algebra by putting it into a "
"box or frame. It’s not that this stuff is not important or useful, but for "
"some students they may wish to skip over it and therefore the boxing of "

"In this adaptation of the excellent “Learning statistics with R”, by "
"Danielle Navarro, we have replaced the statistical software used for the "
"analyses and examples with jamovi. Although R is a powerful statistical "
"programming language, it is not the first choice for every instructor and "
"student at the beginning of their statistical learning. Some instructors and "
"students tend to prefer the point-and-click style of software, and that’s "
"where jamovi comes in. jamovi is software that aims to simplify two aspects "
"of using R. It offers a point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI), and "
"it also provides functions that combine the capabilities of many others, "
"bringing a more SPSS- or SAS-like method of programming to R. Importantly, "
"jamovi will always be free and open - that’s one of its core values - "
"because jamovi is made by the scientific community, for the scientific "
"community."

"Another year, another update. This time around, the update has focused "

"All of the above being said, there is one group of people that I can "

"this book is ideal, because it was written to accompany your stats lectures. "
"If a problem arises due to a shortcoming of these notes, I can and will "
"adapt content on the fly to fix that problem. Effectively, you’ve got a "
"textbook written specifically for your classes, distributed for free "
"(electronic copy) or at near-cost prices (hard copy). Better yet, the notes "

"say so on the student evaluation forms, then you’re totally welcome to – "
"because they’re not. But I am saying that they’ve been tried out in previous "

"Okay, with all that out of the way, I should say something about what the "
"book aims to be. At its core, it is an introductory statistics textbook "
"pitched primarily at psychology students. As such, it covers the standard "
"topics that you’d expect of such a book: study design, descriptive "
"statistics, the theory of hypothesis testing, *t*-tests, χ²-tests, ANOVA and "
"regression. However, there are also several chapters devoted to the "
"R statistical package, including a chapter on data manipulation and another "
"one on scripts and programming. Moreover, when you look at the content "
"presented in the book, you’ll notice a lot of topics that are traditionally "
"swept under the carpet when teaching statistics to psychology students. The "
"Bayesian / frequentist divide is openly disussed in the probability chapter, "
"and the disagreement between Neyman and Fisher about hypothesis testing "
"makes an appearance. The difference between probability and density is "
"discussed. A detailed treatment of Type I, II and III sums of squares for "
"unbalanced factorial ANOVA is provided. And if you have a look in the "
"Epilogue, it should be clear that my intention is to add a lot more advanced "
"content."

"My reasons for pursuing this approach are pretty simple: the students can "
"handle it, and they even seem to enjoy it. Over the last few years I’ve been "
"pleasantly surprised at just how little difficulty I’ve had in getting "
"undergraduate psych students to learn R. It’s certainly not easy for them, "
"and I’ve found I need to be a little charitable in setting marking "
"standards, but they do eventually get there. Similarly, they don’t seem to "
"have a lot of problems tolerating ambiguity and complexity in presentation "
"of statistical ideas, as long as they are assured that the assessment "
"standards will be set in a fashion that is appropriate for them. So if the "
"students can handle it, why *not* teach it? The potential gains are pretty "
"enticing. If they learn R, the students get access to CRAN, which is perhaps "
"the largest and most comprehensive library of statistical tools in "
"existence. And if they learn about probability theory in detail, it’s easier "
"for them to switch from orthodox null hypothesis testing to Bayesian methods "
"if they want to. Better yet, they learn data analysis skills that they can "
"take to an employer without being dependent on expensive and proprietary "
"software."

"Sadly, this book isn’t the silver bullet that makes all this possible. It’s "

"provide a basic introduction to statistics using R, and I’m not arrogant "
"enough to believe that mine is better. Still, I rather like the book, and "

"something weird about trying to “learn what we do not know from what we do "
"know”. The critical point is that assumptions and biases are unavoidable if "
"you want to learn anything about the world. There is no escape from this, "
"and it is just as true for statistical inference as it is for human "
"reasoning. In the dialogue I was taking aim at your perfectly sensible "

"be. My “logical analysis” rejects that assumption entirely. All I was "
"willing to accept is that there are sequences of wins and losses and that I "
"did not know which sequences would be observed. Throughout the dialogue I "
"kept insisting that all logically possible data sets were equally plausible "
