"Previous chapters have covered statistical tests for differences between two "

"each other and whether the patterns of relatedness suggest anything "
"interesting and meaningful. For example, we are often interested in "
"exploring whether there are any underlying unobserved **latent factors** "
"that are represented by the observed, directly measured, variables in our "

"In exploratory factor analysis (EFA), we are essentially exploring the "

"factors and to identify which of our variables have a high loading\\ [#]_ (e."
"g. loading > 0.5) on each factor, suggesting they are a useful measure, or "
"indicator, of the latent factor. Part of this process includes a step called "
"rotation, which to be honest is a pretty weird idea but luckily we don’t "
"have to worry about understanding it; we just need to know that it is "
"helpful because it makes the pattern of loadings on different factors much "
"clearer. As such, rotation helps with seeing more clearly which variables "
"are linked substantively to each factor. We also need to decide how many "
"factors are reasonable given our data, and helpful in this regard is "
"something called Eigen values. We’ll come back to this in a moment, after we "

"There are a couple of assumptions that need to be checked as part of the "
"analysis. The first assumption is **sphericity**, which essentially checks "
"that the variables in your dataset are correlated with each other to the "
"extent that they can potentially be summarised with a smaller set of "
"factors. Bartlett’s test for sphericity checks whether the observed "
"correlation matrix diverges significantly from a zero (or null) correlation "
"matrix. So, if Bartlett’s test is significant (p < 0.05), this indicates "
"that the observed correlation matrix is significantly divergent from the "
"null, and is therefore suitable for EFA."

#: ../../Ch15/Ch15_FactorAnalysis_1.rst:85

"The second assumption is **sampling adequacy** and is checked using the "
"Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA). The KMO index "
"is a measure of the proportion of variance among observed variables that "
"might be common variance. Using partial correlations, it checks for factors "
"that load just two items. We seldom, if ever, want EFA producing a lot of "
"factors loading just two items each. KMO is about sampling adequacy because "
"partial correlations are typically seen with inadequate samples. If the KMO "
"index is high (≈ 1), the EFA is efficient whereas if KMO is low (≈ 0), the "
"EFA is not relevant. KMO values smaller than 0.5 indicates that EFA is not "
"suitable and a KMO value of 0.6 should be present before EFA is considered "
"suitable. Values between 0.5 and 0.7 are considered adequate, values between "
"0.7 and 0.9 are good and values between 0.9 and 1.0 are excellent."

"constructs, use EFA to see which items “go together” as latent factors, and "

"A popular statistic used to check the internal consistency of a scale is "

"the two parts gives comparable results. Of course, there are many ways a set "
"of items could be split, but if all possible splits are made then it is "
"possible to produce a statistic that reflects the overall pattern of split-"
"half coefficients. Cronbach’s α is such a statistic: a function of all the "
"split-half coefficients for a scale. If a set of items that measure a "
"construct (e.g. an Extraversion scale) has an α of 0.80, then the proportion "

"BUT, (and that’s a BIG “BUT”), Cronbach’s α is not a measure of "

"factor or construct rather than multiple related constructs). Scales that "
"are multidimensional will cause α to be under-estimated if not assessed "
"separately for each dimension, but high values for α are not necessarily "
"indicators of unidimensionality. So, an α of 0.80 does not mean that 80\\% "

"representative sample. α can even vary from large sample to large sample. "
"Nevertheless, despite these limitations, Cronbach’s α has been popular in "

":doc:`Ch15_FactorAnalysis_3` (CFA). Unlike EFA, with CFA you start with an "
