"It’s sort of obvious but worth saying anyway: doing your statistics on a "

"Computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks, and a lot of statistical "
"calculations are both mindless and repetitive. For most people the only "
"reason to ever do statistical calculations with pencil and paper is for "
"learning purposes. In my class I do occasionally suggest doing some "
"calculations that way, but the only real value to it is pedagogical. It does "

"Doing statistics in a conventional spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel) is "

"Avoiding proprietary software is a very good idea. There are a lot of "
"commercial packages out there that you can buy, some of which I like and "
"some of which I don’t. They’re usually very glossy in their appearance and "
"generally very powerful (much more powerful than spreadsheets). However, "
"they’re also very expensive. Usually, the company sells “student "
"versions” (limited versions of the real thing) very cheaply, and then they "
"they sell full powered “educational versions” at a price that makes me "
"wince. They will also sell commercial licences with a staggeringly high "
"price tag. The business model here is to suck you in during your student "
"days and then leave you dependent on their tools when you go out into the "
"real world. It’s hard to blame them for trying, but personally I’m not in "
"favour of shelling out thousands of dollars if I can avoid it. And you can "

"Something that you might not appreciate now, but will love later on if you "

"sophisticated front end for the free R statistical programming language. "
"When you download and install R you get all the basic “packages” and those "
"are very powerful on their own. However, because R is so open and so widely "
"used, it’s become something of a standard tool in statistics and so lots of "
"people write their own packages that extend the system. And these are freely "

"``header``. A lot of the time when you’re storing data as a CSV file the "
"first row actually contains the column names and not data. If that’s not "
"true then it’s a good idea to open up the CSV file in a spreadsheet "
"programme such as LibreOffice and add the header row manually."

"``sep``. As the name “comma separated value” indicates, the values in a row "
"of a CSV file are usually separated by commas. This isn’t universal, "
"however. In Europe the decimal point is typically written as ``,`` instead "
"of ``.`` and as a consequence it would be somewhat awkward to use ``,`` as "
"the separator. Therefore it is not unusual to use ``;`` instead of ``,`` as "
"the separator. At other times, I’ve seen a TAB character used."

"``quote``. It’s conventional in CSV files to include a quoting character for "

"``skip``. It’s actually very common to receive CSV files in which the first "
"few rows have nothing to do with the actual data. Instead, they provide a "
"human readable summary of where the data came from, or maybe they include "
"some technical info that doesn’t relate to the data."

"``missing values``. Often you’ll get given data with missing values. For one "
"reason or another, some entries in the table are missing. The data file "
"needs to include a “special” value to indicate that the entry is missing. By "
"default jamovi assumes that this value is ``NA``,\\ [#]_ for both numeric "
"and text data, so you should make sure that, where necessary, all missing "
"values in the CSV file are replaced with ``99`` (or ``-9999``; whichever you "
"choose) before opening / importing the file into jamovi. Once you have "
"opened / imported the file into jamovi all the missing values are converted "
"to blank or greyed out cells in the jamovi spreadsheet view. You can also "
"change the missing value for each variable as an option in the ``Data`` → "
"``Setup`` view."
