"The ideas I’ve presented to you in this book describe inferential statistics "
"from the frequentist perspective. I’m not alone in doing this. In fact, "
"almost every textbook given to undergraduate psychology students presents "
"the opinions of the frequentist statistician as *the* theory of inferential "
"statistics, the one true way to do things. I have taught this way for "
"practical reasons. The frequentist view of statistics dominated the academic "
"field of statistics for most of the 20th century, and this dominance is even "
"more extreme among applied scientists. It was and is current practice among "
"psychologists to use frequentist methods. Because frequentist methods are "
"ubiquitous in scientific papers, every student of statistics needs to "
"understand those methods, otherwise they will be unable to make sense of "
"what those papers are saying! Unfortunately, in my opinion at least, the "
"current practice in psychology is often misguided and the reliance on "
"frequentist methods is partly to blame. In this chapter I explain why I "
"think this and provide an introduction to Bayesian statistics, an approach "
"that I think is generally superior to the orthodox approach."

"From a Bayesian perspective statistical inference is all about *belief "

"world. I don’t know which of these hypotheses is true, but do I have some "
"beliefs about which hypotheses are plausible and which are not. When I "
"observe the data, *d*, I have to revise those beliefs. If the data are "
"consistent with a hypothesis, my belief in that hypothesis is strengthened. "
"If the data are inconsistent with the hypothesis, my belief in that "
"hypothesis is weakened. That’s it! At the end of this section I’ll give a "
"precise description of how Bayesian reasoning works, but first I want to "
"work through a simple example in order to introduce the key ideas. Consider "

"When the study starts out you follow the rules, refusing to look at the data "
"or run any tests. But when you reach *N* = 50 your willpower gives in… and "
"you take a peek. Guess what? You’ve got a significant result! Now, sure, you "
"know you *said* that you’d keep running the study out to a sample size of "
"*N* = 80, but it seems sort of pointless now, right? The result is "
"significant with a sample size of *N* = 50, so wouldn’t it be wasteful and "
"inefficient to keep collecting data? Aren’t you tempted to stop? Just a "
"little? Well, keep in mind that if you do, your Type I error rate at *p* < "
"0.05 just ballooned out to 8\\%. When you report *p* < 0.05 in your paper, "
"what you’re *really* saying is *p* < 0.08. That’s how bad the consequences "

"Now consider this. The scientific literature is filled with *t*-tests, "
"ANOVAs, regressions and χ²-tests. When I wrote this book I didn’t pick these "
"tests arbitrarily. The reason why these four tools appear in most "
"introductory statistics texts is that these are the bread and butter tools "
"of science. None of these tools include a correction to deal with “data "
"peeking”: they all assume that you’re not doing it. But how realistic is "
"that assumption? In real life, how many people do you think have “peeked” at "
"their data before the experiment was finished and adapted their subsequent "
"behaviour after seeing what the data looked like? Except when the sampling "
"procedure is fixed by an external constraint, I’m guessing the answer is "
"“most people have done it”. If that has happened, you can infer that the "
"reported *p*-values are wrong. Worse yet, because we don’t know what "
"decision process they actually followed, we have no way to know what the *p*-"
"values *should* have been. You can’t compute a *p*-value when you don’t know "
"the decision making procedure that the researcher used. And so the reported "
"*p*-value remains a lie."

"Yes, you might try to defend *p*-values by saying that it’s the fault of the "
"researcher for not using them properly, but to my mind that misses the "
"point. A theory of statistical inference that is so completely naive about "
"humans that it doesn’t even consider the possibility that the researcher "
